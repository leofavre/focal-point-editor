# Focal Point Editor

Mask images in responsive layouts without losing what matters most.

## Steps

1. Choose an image
   - Select an image from your device or the web. Images stay where they are — no uploads.

2. Edit the focal point
   - Preview how the image behaves across different aspect ratios. Drag the image within the mask to control how it’s cropped.

3. Grab the code
   - When you're done, copy the HTML and CSS code to use the image in full-width banners and responsive layouts.
